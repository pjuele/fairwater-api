# vs. what they promised (=commitment)

    score = round(
        progress + challenge - commitment - agency # no weights needed because both are 0-10

# International Help Priority Score:
#
# Intention: Water access emergencies (without focusing too much on feasibility of projects)
#
# I.e. BfB score might signal Kenya as a top country to target for help. South Sudan might
# need it more, but be bumped down in BfB because projects there are less likely to succeed.
# We still want to know where the emergencies are (i.e. "where are people dying")
#
# With our limited data: what we do is not take commitment into account, and focus on their
# challenges, but tone that down based on their self reliance (= agency + progress)
#
# J: weight against the country's population (bpl)

# Bang for Bucks Score:
#
# Intention: Where are we most likely to have the biggest impact (sooner). We want this to
# take into account not just raw need, but also the likelihood to create sustained impact
# (the chance a project has to succeed and remain)
#
# With our limited data: we focus on how big the need is (=challenge) and whether there is
# already some sort of framework / capabilities in place (=progress).
# Then we bump that up a bit with their commitment, and bump it down a bit with their agency
# (these last to are weighted down to have less impact over challenge and progress)
# 
# J: use p/c gdp as an indicator of how expensive a project there would be
# J: use stability
